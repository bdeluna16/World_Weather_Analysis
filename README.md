# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
In this project we were tasked with updating the PlanMyTrip app. Updating the app involved the following:
    
    1. Adding the weather description to the weather data we retrived from a Google API
    2. Creating an input statement that allowed users to filter the data for their weather preferences, which would then be used to identify potential travel destinations and hotels
    3. Using the Google Maps Directions API to create a feature where users can pick up to four cities and create a travel itinerary. The itinerary also includes travel routes to each destination.
